# Insurance Charges Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **medical insurance charges** using machine learning.
It is a **regression-based problem** where customer attributes are used to estimate insurance costs.

The goal of this project is to understand how different factors influence insurance charges
and to build a predictive model using a standard machine learning workflow.
